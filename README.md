This Panzer weather widget is an attractive set of dieselpunk Yahoo widgets for 
your desktop. It is a set of weather gauges. The widget consists of five gauges, 
a clipboard display and a tape reading device. The five gauges are: a barometer for telling 
the pressure; an anemometer for displaying the wind speed and direction; a 
thermometer for the temperature; a humidity gauge. The use of the five gauges 
will allow you to determine the weather in your local area and the likelihood of 
change. The fifth gauge shows the current weather in iconised form, this is be a 
summary of the information derived from the weather or the current weather 
forecast...

It takes the weather from forecasts provided by airports and airfields. If you 
can find an airfield nearby that has an ICAO code then it will supply local 
weather data. You enter your local town name and if it has an airfield then it 
will have a forecast. The data feed is provided by Aviation Weather GOV - 

	aviationweather.gov/  

In addition there is a clipboard which tells you the weather in textual form.
Double-click on a gauge to get the latest weather. 
 
These Widget gauges are moveable widgets that you can move anywhere around the 
desktop as you require.The widgets can be resized - Hover the cursor over each 
widget. Press the CTRL key and use your mousewheel up or down. The widget will 
resize dynamically.

All javascript widgets need an engine to function, in this case the widget uses 
the Yahoo Widget Konfabulator engine. The engine interprets the javascript and 
creates the widget according to the XML description and using the images you 
provide.
